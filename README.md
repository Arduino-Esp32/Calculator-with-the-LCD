# Calculator-with-the-LCD
MY third project



In this project I used a Serial Monitor to answer from the LCD.  After I finished answering all the questions I printed it all on the LCD. I used a potentiometer to change the brightness of the LCD.

I use the LCD and a potentiometer all connected to an Arduino Uno.

The circuitry was a bit complicated so I used a website called https://toptechboy.com/arduino-tutorial-48-connecting-and-using-an-lcd-display/lcd/ .

After the circuitry I loaded 1 library LiquidCrystal.h and that was for the LCD.  I first asked for the first number and waited for the answer.

After I asked for the second number and waited for the answer.

Then I asked for the operator (+,-,*,/). Finally I worked it out using if statements.
